This is our McHacks project.

We suggest activities you can take part in which will increase your comfort zone and allow you to try new things.
##Instructions
Upon the first time you login, we rate your comfort zone threshold by performing an algorithm based on your willingness to do certain activities. You can swipe left or right to like or dislike the “activity”. Next, we take your threshold and compare that to other peoples views on the activities you made decisions on. This allows us to suggest things you could do to increase your comfort zone. When you are in the dashboard area, you can complete activities at your own pace. As your comfort zone incerases, more activities become plausible to complete.


##To do list

- Use a forked version of the [Tinder](https://github.com/Diolor/Swipecards) gradle library project to handle the Tinder swiping 
- Add a front-end web component
- Clean this code
- Comment this code
- Refactor the directory structure to be like actual Android apps

##Credits

Thanks to [Diolor](https://github.com/Diolor/Swipecards) for helping with the Tinder swiping.
I should have used this in gradle as a library project instead of copying and pasting but it’s a hackathon and we’re just rushing out features :)
